## API3 Bounties

### 🥇 Build a modification on a borrow/lending dapp to reallocate liquidation profits using API3’s OEV network - $5000

Modify an existing dapp to distribute profits using your logic.  Currently, liquidation profits get lost to MEV bots.  Using the OEV network (Oracle Extractable Value), create a way to redistribute the profits. [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/dapis?utm_source=Eth+Istanbul&utm_medium=Github&utm_campaign=Eth+Istanbul).

Project Ideas:
- Fund publics goods by auto distributing through a smart contract. MEV for good, share of a portion of the profits to support open source projects
- Reward current stakers of the dapp with a bonus.  Give an increase of percentage of return to attract users to your dapp. 
- Lower the penalty of the liquidation. Attract more borrowers to your dapp by having a smaller penalty on liquidations

Example Repo: [How to bid in the auction to update a price feed](https://github.com/api3-ecosystem/oev_priceupdate_example) 

### 🥇 Maximize your profit of the OEV (Oracle Extractable Value) share - $6000

API3 will be hosting a liquidable position with a controlled dAPI price feed that will be lowering value over time to increase the profit position of the liquidation.  Maximize your strategy to win the price update auction and execute the liquidation with the most profit.

## Introduction to API3

First-party oracles provide a more secure and reliable oracle, whilst enabling dApps to verify the data source. API3's first-party oracles are powered by Airnode, a serverless oracle node that enables API providers to run their own oracle nodes.
You can [learn more about first-party oracles](https://docs.api3.org/guides/airnode/calling-an-airnode/?utm_source=Eth+Istanbul&utm_medium=Github&utm_campaign=Eth+Istanbul) within the API3 Documentation.


##  Oracle Extractable Value - The OEV Network
The OEV network allows external users to bid to update price feeds for potential gain in profit.  Bids are done on the OEV network and updates to price feeds are done on the requested chain.

Example Repo: [How to bid in the auction to update a price feed](https://github.com/api3-ecosystem/oev_priceupdate_example) 

### Data feeds: dAPIs

dAPIs provide smart contracts with access to continuously updated feeds of market data by oracles hosted by highly reputable financial data providers. API3's price feeds can be accessed in two methods:

Self-funded dAPIs see users add collateral for oracle operation and are permissionless. They provide a data feed source with off-chain aggregation as a single source.

Managed dAPIs are powered by multiple first-party oracles with native-chain aggregation offering a verifiable, decentralized oracle solution.
Once a dAPI has been integrated a smart contract can access a range of data feed services through the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/dapis?utm_source=Eth+Istanbul&utm_medium=Github&utm_campaign=Eth+Istanbul).

## Submission Requirements

All hackathon participants who are competing for the API3 bounties are required to submit a project that meets the following requirements:

- The project should be submitted to ETH Denver Hackathon 2024 by the deadline.
- Use of API3’s OEV Network that facilitates a proper use-case.
- The project should be live with a working frontend deployed.

- The repo must be licenced with one of the following open source licences: GPL-3.0, or MIT.

## Judging criteria

Participants may submit a maximum of 1 project by the hackathon deadline. After submission, projects will be judged by the following criteria:

- **Real-world Functionality**: How well does the project work? Does it meet the minimum requirements?

- **Technical Difficulty**: How technically challenging was it to build the project?

- **Originality**: How original is the idea? How much does it differ from other existing solutions?

- **Design**: How well-designed is the project? Is it easy to use? Is it visually appealing?
