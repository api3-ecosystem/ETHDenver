## API3 Bounties

### ðŸ¥‡ Build a modification on a borrow/lending dapp to reallocate liquidation profits using API3â€™s OEV network - $5000

Modify an existing dapp to distribute profits using your logic.  Currently, liquidation profits get lost to MEV bots.  Using the OEV network (Oracle Extractable Value), create a way to redistribute the profits. [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/dapis?utm_source=Eth+Istanbul&utm_medium=Github&utm_campaign=Eth+Istanbul).

Project Ideas:
- Fund publics goods by auto distributing through a smart contract. MEV for good, share of a portion of the profits to support open source projects
- Reward current stakers of the dapp with a bonus.  Give an increase of percentage of return to attract users to your dapp. 
- Lower the penalty of the liquidation. Attract more borrowers to your dapp by having a smaller penalty on liquidations

Example Repo: [How to bid in the auction to update a price feed](https://github.com/api3-ecosystem/oev_priceupdate_example) 

### ðŸ¥‡ Maximize your profit of the OEV (Oracle Extractable Value) share - $6000

API3 will be hosting a liquidable position with a controlled dAPI price feed that will be lowering value over time to increase the profit position of the liquidation.  Maximize your strategy to win the price update auction and execute the liquidation with the most profit.

## Important information

You will need ETH on both ETH Sepolia and the OEV Network for full functionality.

Only a small amount of ETH is needed for bids and transactions costs on the OEV Network. 

You can request OEV Network ETH in the [API3 discord](https://discord.gg/api3dao) within the `ECOSYSTEM TALK =>  OEV Section` [API3 Discord](https://discord.gg/api3dao):

To add the OEV Network to you metamask, please add the following network details:
```
- Network Name: OEV Sepolia Testnet

- RPC URL: https://oev-network-sepolia-testnet-rpc.eu-north-2.gateway.fm

- Chain ID: 736160594

- Currency symbol: ETH

- Block explorer URL: https://oev-network-sepolia-testnet-blockscout.eu-north-2.gateway.fm
```

Once the API3 has sent the OEV ETH, you can check your wallet to verify that you have some ETH on the OEV network.

## Introduction to API3

First-party oracles provide a more secure and reliable oracle, whilst enabling dApps to verify the data source. API3's first-party oracles are powered by Airnode, a serverless oracle node that enables API providers to run their own oracle nodes.
You can [learn more about first-party oracles](https://docs.api3.org/guides/airnode/calling-an-airnode/?utm_source=Eth+Istanbul&utm_medium=Github&utm_campaign=Eth+Istanbul) within the API3 Documentation.


##  Oracle Extractable Value - The OEV Network
The OEV network allows external users to bid to update price feeds for potential gain in profit.  Bids are done on the OEV network and updates to price feeds are done on the requested chain.
